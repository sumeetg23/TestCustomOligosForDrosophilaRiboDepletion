# Testing Custom FLy Oligos For Ribo Depletion

1. Design Oligos: Custom oligos were designed by KAPA so they are compatible with the KAPA ribodepletion kit. We sent them sequences for 28S, 18S, 16S, 5S and 5.8S.

	```
	16S turned out to be AT rich. So we decided to try ribo depletion with and without 16S.
	```
   
2. Library prep: Libraries were prepped using 4 drosophila samples and 3 conditions:

	```

   	Condition #1: Ribodepletion using Human-Mouse-Rat oligos that come with the standard riboerase kit. 
       Sample names - Y1-HMR, Y2-HMR, Y3-HMR, Y4-HMR
       
   	Condition #2: Ribodepletion using custom fly oligos (including 16S). 
       Sample names - Y1-16SDepleted, Y2-16SDepleted, Y3-16SDepleted, Y4-16SDepleted
       
   	Condition #3: Ribodepletion using custom fly oligos (NOT including 16S). 
       Sample names - Y1-NO16SDepletion, Y2-NO16SDepletion, Y3-NO16SDepletion, Y4-NO16SDepletion
       
	```


3. QC: Libraries were QC'ed using BioA and qPCR. HMR kit appeared to be choppy while custom oligo libraries looked good with a bell like distribution of fragments.

4. Sequencing: All libraries were sequenced, in a single lane, on HiSeq 2500 for 50 bases

5. Analysis: 

1. Amount of duplication (higher mean lower complexity data)
