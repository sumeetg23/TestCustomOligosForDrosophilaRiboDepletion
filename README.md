# Testing Custom FLy Oligos For Ribo Depletion

1. Design Oligos: Custom oligos were designed by KAPA so they are compatible with the KAPA ribodepletion kit. We sent them sequences for 28S, 18S, 16S, 5S and 5.8S.

   16S turned out to be AT rich. So we decided to try ribo depletion with and without 16S.
   
   
2. Library prep: Libraries were prepped using 4 drosophila samples and 3 conditions:

   Condition #1: Ribodepletion using Human-Mouse-Rat oligos that come with the standard riboerase kit. 
       Sample names - Y1-HMR, Y2-HMR, Y3-HMR, Y4-HMR
       
   Condition #2: Ribodepletion using custom fly oligos (including 16S). 
       Sample names - Y1-16SDepleted, Y2-16SDepleted, Y3-16SDepleted, Y4-16SDepleted
       
   Condition #3: Ribodepletion using custom fly oligos (NOT including 16S). 
       Sample names - Y1-NO16SDepletion, Y2-NO16SDepletion, Y3-NO16SDepletion, Y4-NO16SDepletion

3. QC: Libraries were QC'ed using BioA and qPCR. HMR kit appeared to be choppy while custom oligo libraries looked good with a bell like distribution of fragments.

4. Sequencing: All libraries were sequenced, in a single lane, on HiSeq 2500 for 50 bases

5. Analysis:
